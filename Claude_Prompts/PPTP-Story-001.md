- IssueID = PPTP-Story-001
- Target Folder = Assets/PPTP
- Please read 'Claude_Prompts/PPTPBasePrompt.md' for project context
- This is a continuation of the issue PPTP-Story-001, so please read the chroma article on that issue
- Please create a new system 'BallBoxAlternateSystem' 
- functionally it should be comparable to the created 'Mandelbrot3DSystem'. Simularly this system should work in burst ECS, and use parallel jobs to render/generate a mesh on an entity 
- in this case it should animate/tween between a cube shape and a ball shape in runtime
- runtime component/authoring settings should include
	- the duration between a shape change
	- the size of the ball
	- the number of verts/tesselation of the ball
	- the size of the cube
	- the number of verts/tesselation of the cube
