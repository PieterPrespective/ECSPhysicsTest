- IssueID = PPTP-Story-001
- Target Folder = Assets/PPTP
- Please read 'Claude_Prompts/PPTPBasePrompt.md' for project context
- Please check the rendering methods applied in the 'BallBoxAlternateSystem' against the approach used in the following script: 'https://github.com/Dreaming381/Latios-Framework-Add-Ons/blob/main/AddOns/Cyline/BuildLineRenderer3DMeshSystem.cs' 
	- The Approach used in 'BuildLineRenderer3DMeshSystem.cs' doesn't seem to rely on updating on the main thread - is there some way we could make use of this system without losing the current mesh generation and rendering capabilities; specifically
		- Multiple seperate instances, each with a unique mesh - likely with different UVW, materials and vertex count
		- Meshes need to be able to change in runtime (morph)
		- Please deeply investigate and report an what would work best
- Likely you will want to explore the 'Latios-Framework' codebase further, specifically:
