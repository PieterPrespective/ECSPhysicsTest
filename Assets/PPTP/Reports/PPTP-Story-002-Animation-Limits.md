# BallBox Animation Update Limits - Fixed

## The Problem
Only a few entities were updating their animations because of frame budget limits designed to maintain performance.

## Where the Limits Were Set

### 1. **BallBoxMeshApplicationSystem** (Main Bottleneck)
```csharp
// OLD VALUES:
private const int MaxMeshUpdatesPerFrame = 10;        // Only 10 meshes per frame
private const float MaxFrameTimeMs = 2.0f;           // Only 2ms per frame

// NEW VALUES:
private const int MaxMeshUpdatesPerFrame = 50;       // 50 meshes per frame  
private const float MaxFrameTimeMs = 8.0f;          // 8ms per frame
```

**Impact**: With 100 entities (10×10), old settings meant:
- 10 entities updated per frame
- 10 frames needed to update all entities initially
- Animation appeared very sluggish

### 2. **BallBoxMeshGenerationSystem** (Secondary Limit)  
```csharp
// OLD: Update every 2 frames during animation
tracker.FramesSinceUpdate > 2

// NEW: Update every frame during animation
tracker.FramesSinceUpdate > 0
```

**Impact**: More responsive animation updates during morphing.

### 3. **Mesh Pool System** (Resource Limit)
The user increased `MAX_MESHES` from 10 to 10000, removing the pool bottleneck.

## Performance Balance

### **Conservative Settings** (Smooth 60fps)
- `MaxMeshUpdatesPerFrame = 10`
- `MaxFrameTimeMs = 2.0f` 
- Good for: 25-50 entities with stable performance

### **Balanced Settings** (Current)
- `MaxMeshUpdatesPerFrame = 50`
- `MaxFrameTimeMs = 8.0f`
- Good for: 100-400 entities with good performance

### **Aggressive Settings** (For extreme testing)
- `MaxMeshUpdatesPerFrame = 100+`
- `MaxFrameTimeMs = 16.0f` (full frame budget)
- Good for: 1000+ entities, may impact framerate

## Expected Results Now

### **10×10 Grid (100 entities)**:
- **Before**: 10 frames to fully populate animations = sluggish
- **After**: 2 frames to fully populate animations = smooth

### **20×20 Grid (400 entities)**:
- **Before**: 40 frames to populate = very sluggish  
- **After**: 8 frames to populate = responsive

### **Performance Monitoring**
The system logs performance metrics:
```
BallBoxMeshApplication: Processed 47 mesh updates in 6.23ms
```

Watch for:
- **Updates per frame**: Should be close to the limit (50)
- **Time per frame**: Should stay under limit (8ms)
- **Frame rate**: Should maintain target FPS

## Runtime Tuning

If you need to adjust performance on the fly, modify the constants in:
- `BallBoxMeshApplicationSystem.cs` (lines 27-28)
- `BallBoxMeshGenerationSystem.cs` (line 118)

Or create a `BallBoxPerformanceConfig` ScriptableObject for easy runtime tweaking.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Start with current settings** for 10×10 grids
2. **Monitor console logs** for performance metrics  
3. **Increase limits gradually** if you need more entities
4. **Watch frame rate** - reduce limits if FPS drops below target

The animation should now be much more responsive across all entities in the grid!
